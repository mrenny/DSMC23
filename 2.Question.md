Organic bioelectronics are a promising technology for interfacing between machines and phisiology. Organic bioelectronics are devices made of organic materials, with tunable mechanical and chemical properties, making them highly biocompatible.[^1]  With their low-cost manufacturing routes,[^2]  organic bioelectronics have proven promising in applications across human health care monitoring and precision agriculture.[^3] 

In this work, I have designed an organic bioelectronic sensor-based psychrometer, which measures the inernal water potential (hydration) of living plants. This psychrometer is based off an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). This psy-OECT, as I will refer to it as, can be implanted into thinner and softer species than other commercially-available sensors can, allowing us to monitor for when plants are feeling drought stressed.

Although organic bioelectronics have shown great potential, in demonstrations like sensing pre-epileptic behavior in rats and acting to prevent seizure-like behavior,[^4] most demonstrations have been in highly-controlled lab environments.[^5] These devices operate on intimate connections to phisological markers, like ions and hormones, which offers them the ability to amplify small biological signals.[^6] However, this same capabaility makes them highly sensitive to temperature, meaning that variation in temperature will affects the integrity of the sensor.[^7]

Here, I will demonstrate how we can gain valuble information from the psy-OECT by analyzing its signal using multiple linear regression. Such a multivariate technique allows us to discover the independent effects of temperature and water potential on our sensor response. By accounting for temperature in this way, we can more confidently monitor for stress response to drought in plants.[^8]
