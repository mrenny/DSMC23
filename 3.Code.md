### In this work, I expand a traditional, single parameter readout methodology to a multi-parameter readout
<p></p>
We typically look at the transient current,**I(t)** through OECT-based sensors, and use one parameter, **dQ**, as the independent variable when tracking the the dependent variable being sensed. 

Using the same **I(t)**, I obtain four parameters instead:
- **I0**: the initial current
- **dI**: the change in current
- **ti**: the ionic speed of the device
- **te**: the electronic speed of the device
<p></p> 
The traditional parameter, dQ, represents dI, normalized by I0, over a short period of time, making it dependent on both ti and te. However, in order to separate independent effects of water potential (hydration) and temperature on the device, we expand to four parameters.

### Cross section of data used

### R Code used to produce Multiple Linear Regression Model
```R
#Import CSV data the long way
df <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Megan\\Documents\\Data\\data.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
#Subset data to only include the first 200 total hours, and only when the plant had been within 72 hours of being watered
d <-subset(d, time<=200 & timew<=72)
#Find the traditional model
Pq <- lm(d$psm ~ d$dQ)
#Expand to multiple linear regression
Pqt <- lm(d$psm ~ d$dQ + d$ts)
#Look at how dQ is affected by water potential and temperature over all 200 hrs
e <-subset(d, time<=200)
Qpt <- lm(d$dQ ~ d$psm + d$ts)
#Make a new model with expanded parameters
Pbt <- lm(d$psm ~ d$ti + d$te + d$I0 + d$dI + d$ts)
#Include a factor of time since the plant was last watered, w,
#w = -1*exp{-1*[time/(2.1*24)]} 
#2.1 is a the speed of soil drying in days
Pbtw <- lm(d$psm ~ d$ti + d$te + d$I0 + d$dI + d$ts + d$w)
#Not all models are nested, so we will compare models with AIC
AIC(Pq,Pqt,Pbt,Pbtw)
require(broom)
View(tidy(Pq))
View(tidy(Pqt))
View(tidy(Pbt))
View(tidy(Pbtw))
```

### Model vs Recorded Values
Here is how that prediction looks

### Reproduction as Python Script
```python
#to be worked on
```
